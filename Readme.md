Can you please do a thorough analysis to understand all the different features that exist in this react native appand its subcomponents and document that in an MD file? Divide the files based on feature. Keep the documentation concise. I really just want a bullet point list of all the features and maybe some edge cases of those features so that later on, if I ask someone to edit the timeline, you don't break anything.
